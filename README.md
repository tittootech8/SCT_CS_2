# SCT_CS_2
🔐 Image Encryption Tool
 A Python-based Image Encryption Tool with a Tkinter GUI. Supports XOR, pixel swapping, add/subtract, and bit shifting methods for encrypting/decrypting images. Built using Pillow, it’s ideal for learning cryptography concepts, academic demos, and lightweight image security.

✨ Features
 -🖼️ Load and view images (JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, etc.)
 -🔑 Enter custom encryption key

🔄 Multiple encryption methods:
 -XOR Operation
 -Pixel Swapping
 -Add/Subtract (mod 256)
 -Bit Shifting

🛡️ Symmetric encryption → same key required for decryption
💾 Save encrypted & decrypted images
🎨 Clean, user-friendly Tkinter GUI
